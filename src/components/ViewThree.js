          <Typography>The ROC curve shows the ratio between True Positive and False Positive rates at different classification thresholds. These thresholds are what is used in the AD Breakdown to adjust for the level of risk a user is willing to experience when looking at potentially anomalous transactions. AUC stands for Area Under the Curve, and represents the overall accuracy of an anomaly detection method at all thresholds.</Typography>

          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Machine learning has become a hot topic in the fraud detection industry as companies are switching from rule-based approaches to ML-based solutions. One major benefit that comes with using ML approaches is the ability for real-time processing of account behavior to determine whether a transaction might be fraudulent.
            <br/><br/>
            MADIâ€™s advantage as a novel anomaly detection method is its interpretability.
